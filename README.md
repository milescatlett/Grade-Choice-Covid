# Grade-Choice-Covid

This project was a standalone script run manually from the script editor in a sheet. The goal was to pull all the rows in which a student's name appeared, each row containing a grade that the student could elect to change (based on requirements for grading at the end of the spring 2020 semester, after Covid-19 hit), and create a Google Doc with student choices shared with the student email. The student could then go and submit a form to make any allowed and desired changes. 

I worked in collaboration with the district accountability department to develop a script that people in the department could run to send out notifications.
